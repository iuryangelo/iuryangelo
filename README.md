Our group’s research interests are  in the modeling of physical processes generated by the breaking of ocean waves, which occur at the air-sea interface: such as  momentum, heat and gas transport induced by sea-spray.


#### Research
 - Air-Sea transfer models for the air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide in Sea Spray
 - The effect of Sheltering surface on the momentum flux at the air-sea interface
 - CO2 flux climatology at the air-sea interface

### Research Projects
**Current projects:**
- A climatological study of the effect of spume droplets on CO2 gas exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean
- Assessment of the wave spatial shelter in the air–sea momentum flux
- The effect of shortwave spectrum on the momentum flux at the air-sea interface
